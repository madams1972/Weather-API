This website allows the user to enter a city name and returns the current weather conditions in that city, along with a five day weather forecasts. When the user enters the city name, it automatically drops into the favorites list (using local storage). 
Users can click again on the city name in the favorites list, it will once again display the weather data relevant to that city.

This application was developed using the 'OpenWeather' API. by using the getWeather Function which shows the  current and future weather results in the weather Dashboard.
